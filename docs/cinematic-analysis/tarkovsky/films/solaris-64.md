# Solaris — SUBIT‑64 Decomposition

This document presents a structural decomposition of *Solaris* (1972) through the SUBIT‑64 model.  
The film is treated not as a science‑fiction narrative but as a topological system in which consciousness, memory, and desire interact with a self‑modifying informational field: the Solaris Ocean.

Each of the 64 states corresponds to a distinct informational condition, transition, or attractor within the film’s psychological and metaphysical architecture.

# Conclusion

*Solaris* forms a complete SUBIT‑64 traversal:

- 64 states  
- 8 octants  
- recursive memory  
- materialized desire  
- dissolution of identity  
- reconstitution within a metaphysical field  

The film is not about space exploration — it is a topological exploration of consciousness itself.
