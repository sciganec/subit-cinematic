# Tarkovsky‑320  
### Unified SUBIT‑320 Archetypal Resonance Matrix  
### Stalker • Solaris • Mirror • Nostalgia • The Sacrifice  
### (5 films × 64 archetypal states)

This document expands the Tarkovsky SUBIT Canon to **five films**, producing a **320‑point resonance field**.

Each row corresponds to a **universal SUBIT‑64 archetype**, expressed differently in:

- **Stalker (1979)**
- **Solaris (1972)**
- **Mirror (1975)**
- **Nostalgia (1983)**
- **The Sacrifice (1986)**

This is the structural backbone for the **Tarkovsky‑SUBIT Unified Field**.
