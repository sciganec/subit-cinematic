# Tarkovsky Cross‑Film Archetypal Resonance Maps  
### Stalker ↔ Solaris ↔ SUBIT‑64 Archetype  
### Canonical Cross‑Film Structural Resonance

This document presents the **cross‑film archetypal resonance maps** for *Stalker* (1979) and *Solaris* (1972), aligned through the **SUBIT‑64 universal archetype cycle**.

Each octant represents a **wave of transformation**, and each of the 64 states shows how the same archetypal function manifests differently in both films.

This is the structural backbone for the **Tarkovsky‑64 Canon**.
