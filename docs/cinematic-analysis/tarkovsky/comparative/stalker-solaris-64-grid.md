# Stalker‑64 ↔ Solaris‑64 — Comparative SUBIT Grid

Each row aligns **the same SUBIT‑64 index** across both films:

- **Column 1:** Shared SUBIT state index (1–64)  
- **Column 2:** Stalker‑64 state name  
- **Column 3:** Solaris‑64 state name  

Use this as a **structural comparison layer** on top of the individual expanded files.

This grid is intentionally **minimal and structural** — just the canonical alignment.  
If you want, I can now:

- add a **fourth column** with a 1‑line shared archetype per state,  
- generate a **Mermaid 8×8 matrix** using these pairings,  
- or build a **Tarkovsky‑wide meta‑grid** (Stalker, Solaris, Mirror, etc. on the same 64‑index spine).
