# Tarkovsky SUBIT Mandala  
### Radial Archetypal Field Across Five Films  
### Stalker • Solaris • Mirror • Nostalgia • The Sacrifice

The SUBIT Mandala is a radial representation of the **64‑state archetypal cycle**, arranged as  
**eight transformational waves (octants)**.  
Each wave expresses a distinct mode of becoming: fracture, disorientation, recursion, revelation,  
desire, dissolution, memory, and metaphysical openness.

The mandala format allows the viewer to see Tarkovsky’s cinema not as a sequence of narratives,  
but as a **single rotating field**, where each film traces its own orbit through the same  
archetypal structure.

## 1. Structure of the Mandala

The mandala consists of:

- 8 petals (octants)  
- 8 states per petal  
- 64 total archetypal operators  
- 5 concentric rings (one for each film)

Visual orientation:

[ 57–64 ]  Metaphysical / Open States
[49–56]  Domestic / Memory States
[41–48]  Return / Dissolution
[33–40]  Desire / Projection
[25–32]  Confrontation / Revelation
[17–24]  Immersion / Recursion
[9–16]  Disorientation / Unreality
[1–8]  Origin / Disruption

Each ring corresponds to a film’s traversal of the cycle.

## 2. Reading the Mandala

### Radial direction (center → outward)  
Represents **intensity** and **embodiment**:

- Inner rings (Solaris, Mirror) are more internal, psychological, dreamlike.  
- Outer rings (Stalker, Nostalgia, Sacrifice) manifest the archetypes in physical or ethical form.

### Circular direction (clockwise)  
Represents **progression through the 64‑state cycle**:

1–8 → fracture  
9–16 → disorientation  
17–24 → recursion  
25–32 → revelation  
33–40 → desire  
41–48 → dissolution  
49–56 → memory  
57–64 → metaphysical openness

## 3. The Five Rings (Film Layers)

### Ring 1 — Stalker (1979)  
The Zone as a **moral and metaphysical testing ground**.  
Movement is external, spatial, ritualistic.

### Ring 2 — Solaris (1972)  
The Ocean as a **mirror of consciousness**.  
Movement is internal, recursive, emotional.

### Ring 3 — Mirror (1975)  
Memory as a **nonlinear field**.  
Movement is fragmentary, poetic, involuntary.

### Ring 4 — Nostalgia (1983)  
Exile as **spiritual dislocation**.  
Movement is suspended, hesitant, unresolved.

### Ring 5 — The Sacrifice (1986)  
Sacrifice as **ethical totality**.  
Movement is vertical, existential, absolute.

## 4. Octant Overview

### Octant 1 — Origin / Disruption (1–8)  
The fracture that initiates the cycle.

### Octant 2 — Disorientation / Unreality (9–16)  
Collapse of ordinary logic.

### Octant 3 — Immersion / Recursion (17–24)  
The field begins recursive operations.

### Octant 4 — Confrontation / Revelation (25–32)  
The ethical and emotional core is exposed.

### Octant 5 — Desire / Projection (33–40)  
The field mirrors the deepest desire.

### Octant 6 — Return / Dissolution (41–48)  
The self dissolves and reforms.

### Octant 7 — Domestic / Memory States (49–56)  
Home becomes metaphysical.

### Octant 8 — Metaphysical / Open States (57–64)  
The field reveals its final logic.

## 5. Purpose of the Mandala

The mandala is not an illustration of plot.  
It is a **map of transformation**.

It shows:

- how each film expresses the same archetypal operators  
- how the operators shift tone, medium, and metaphysics  
- how Tarkovsky’s cinema forms a **unified field**  
- how the viewer can navigate the films structurally, not linearly

## 6. Suggested Visual Implementations

You may add diagrams such as:

- radial 8‑petal mandala  
- concentric 5‑ring structure  
- color‑coded octant wheel  
- film‑specific mandalas  

These can be placed in `/diagrams/mandalas/`.

## 8. Closing Note

The mandala is a way of seeing Tarkovsky not as five separate films,  
but as **five rotations of the same archetypal wheel** —  
five attempts to cross the same threshold in different worlds.
