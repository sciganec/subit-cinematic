# Tarkovsky‑256  
### Unified SUBIT‑256 Archetypal Resonance Matrix  
### Stalker • Solaris • Mirror • Nostalgia  
### (4 films × 64 archetypal states)

This document presents the **Tarkovsky‑256 Meta‑Matrix** —  
a unified structural alignment of four films across the **SUBIT‑64 archetypal cycle**.

Each row corresponds to a **universal SUBIT state**, expressed differently in:

- **Stalker (1979)**  
- **Solaris (1972)**  
- **Mirror (1975)**  
- **Nostalgia (1983)**  

This is the canonical backbone for the **Tarkovsky SUBIT Canon**.
