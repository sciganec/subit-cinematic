# Conclusion

This expanded SUBIT‑64 mapping shows *Solaris* as a complete informational cycle:

- from Earth to Solaris to a constructed “home” within the field  
- from denial to surrender  
- from guilt to fragile reconciliation  
- from closed identity to open, unresolved state

It is not about space travel; it is a topological exploration of consciousness.
