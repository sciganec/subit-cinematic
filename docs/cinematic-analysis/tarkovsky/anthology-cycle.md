# Tarkovsky Anthology — SUBIT Cycle Mapping

This document presents a structural mapping of Andrei Tarkovsky’s complete cinematic anthology through the SUBIT model.  
The goal is to reveal the deep, fractal, and topological unity of his films — not as separate works, but as a single evolving informational cycle.

Tarkovsky’s seven feature films form a coherent SUBIT‑8 structure, where each film corresponds to one octant of the cycle.  
The eighth position is intentionally open, functioning as a metaphysical attractor rather than a missing film.

## 1. Overview

Tarkovsky’s anthology behaves as a **closed structural system**:

- each film expresses a distinct informational domain  
- the films mirror and transform one another  
- the sequence forms a complete SUBIT cycle  
- the final film opens the system rather than closing it  

This is why the anthology feels simultaneously linear, circular, and infinite.

## 2. The Seven Films as SUBIT Octants

Below is the canonical mapping of Tarkovsky’s films onto the SUBIT‑8 structure.  
Each film embodies the dominant state‑vector of its octant.

### **Octant 1 — Childhood / Origin**
**Film:** *Ivan’s Childhood* (1962)  
**Vector:** Loss, rupture, premature initiation  
**Function:** Establishes the primordial wound that echoes through the entire cycle.

---

### **Octant 2 — Faith / Devotion**
**Film:** *Andrei Rublev* (1966)  
**Vector:** Spiritual calling, sacrifice, artistic burden  
**Function:** Art as destiny; the emergence of the sacred vector.

---

### **Octant 3 — Memory / Reflection**
**Film:** *Mirror* (1975)  
**Vector:** Fragmentation, temporal recursion, identity dissolution  
**Function:** The anthology folds inward; time becomes a fractal domain.

---

### **Octant 4 — Confrontation / Trial**
**Film:** *Stalker* (1979)  
**Vector:** Ethical conflict, metaphysical testing, triadic tension  
**Function:** The Zone becomes the central topological field of the cycle.

---

### **Octant 5 — Desire / Projection**
**Film:** *Solaris* (1972)  
**Vector:** Manifestation of the unconscious, fear of fulfillment  
**Function:** The Room’s logic appears in cosmic form; desire becomes material.

---

### **Octant 6 — Exile / Distance**
**Film:** *Nostalghia* (1983)  
**Vector:** Separation, longing, metaphysical displacement  
**Function:** The self is divided; the homeland becomes an internal state.

---

### **Octant 7 — Sacrifice / Transformation**
**Film:** *The Sacrifice* (1986)  
**Vector:** Crisis, offering, transcendence through destruction  
**Function:** The cycle approaches dissolution; the world is burned to be renewed.

---

### **Octant 8 — Open State (Unrealized Film)**
**Film:** *Absent by design*  
**Vector:** Potential, continuation, unresolved transcendence  
**Function:** The anthology ends in an open informational state, mirroring the ending of *Stalker*.

This is not a missing film — it is a structural necessity.

## 3. Fractal Correspondences Between Films

Tarkovsky’s anthology is not linear.  
It is **fractal**, meaning films correspond across octants:

- *Mirror* ↔ *Solaris*  
  (memory vs. projection; internal vs. external recursion)

- *Stalker* ↔ *Nostalghia*  
  (trial vs. exile; metaphysical testing vs. metaphysical distance)

- *Ivan’s Childhood* ↔ *The Sacrifice*  
  (origin wound vs. final offering)

- *Andrei Rublev* sits as the stabilizing axis  
  (the sacred vector that anchors the cycle)

These correspondences form a **self‑similar lattice** across the anthology.

---

## 4. The Anthology as a 64‑State System

Each film corresponds to one octant (8 states).  
Together, the seven films cover **56 states** of the SUBIT‑64 cycle.

The remaining **8 states** (Octant 8) are:

- metaphysical  
- unresolved  
- intentionally unrepresented  

This mirrors the structure of *Stalker*, where the final state (64) remains open.

---

## 5. Structural Insights

- The anthology is a **single organism**, not a collection of works.  
- Each film is a **fractal of the whole**.  
- The sequence forms a **closed SUBIT cycle with an open attractor**.  
- The final film (*The Sacrifice*) does not conclude the cycle — it **hands it off** to the open state.  
- The unrealized eighth film is not absence; it is **potential**.

---

## 6. Conclusion

Tarkovsky’s anthology forms a complete SUBIT‑8 cycle:

- Origin  
- Faith  
- Memory  
- Trial  
- Desire  
- Exile  
- Sacrifice  
- Open State  

This structure explains why his body of work feels unified, recursive, and metaphysically coherent.  
It is not simply a filmography — it is a **topological cycle of consciousness**.
