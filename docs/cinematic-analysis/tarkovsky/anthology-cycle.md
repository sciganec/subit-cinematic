# Tarkovsky Anthology — SUBIT Cycle Mapping

This document presents a structural mapping of Andrei Tarkovsky’s complete cinematic anthology through the SUBIT model.  
The anthology is treated not as a sequence of films, but as a unified informational cycle composed of eight octants.  
Each film embodies a distinct state‑vector, and together they form a closed loop of transformation.

The key insight: the earliest film, *The Steamroller and the Violin*, functions as the **final octant**, representing integration and return — a conscious re‑encounter with innocence after the full cycle of experience.

## 1. Overview

Tarkovsky’s seven feature films, together with his diploma film, form a coherent SUBIT‑8 structure:

- each film corresponds to one octant  
- the cycle moves from rupture to sacrifice  
- the final state returns to purity, but transformed  
- the anthology behaves as a fractal system of consciousness  

This mapping reveals the anthology as a single organism rather than a chronological filmography.

## 2. The Eight Octants of the Tarkovsky Cycle

Below is the canonical SUBIT mapping of the anthology.

---

### **Octant 1 — Origin / Wound**  
**Film:** *Ivan’s Childhood* (1962)  
**Archetype:** trauma, rupture, premature initiation  
**Function:** establishes the primal wound that drives the entire cycle.

---

### **Octant 2 — Faith / Devotion**  
**Film:** *Andrei Rublev* (1966)  
**Archetype:** spiritual calling, artistic burden  
**Function:** introduces the sacred vector; art becomes destiny.

---

### **Octant 3 — Memory / Reflection**  
**Film:** *Mirror* (1975)  
**Archetype:** temporal recursion, identity fragmentation  
**Function:** the cycle folds inward; memory becomes a fractal domain.

---

### **Octant 4 — Trial / Confrontation**  
**Film:** *Stalker* (1979)  
**Archetype:** metaphysical testing, ethical conflict  
**Function:** the Zone emerges as the central topological field.

---

### **Octant 5 — Desire / Projection**  
**Film:** *Solaris* (1972)  
**Archetype:** manifestation of the unconscious, fear of fulfillment  
**Function:** desire becomes material; the Room’s logic appears in cosmic form.

---

### **Octant 6 — Exile / Distance**  
**Film:** *Nostalghia* (1983)  
**Archetype:** separation, longing, metaphysical displacement  
**Function:** the self is divided; home becomes an internal state.

---

### **Octant 7 — Sacrifice / Transformation**  
**Film:** *The Sacrifice* (1986)  
**Archetype:** crisis, offering, transcendence through destruction  
**Function:** the cycle approaches dissolution; the world burns to be renewed.

---

### **Octant 8 — Integration / Return**  
**Film:** *The Steamroller and the Violin* (1961)  
**Archetype:** innocence, beginning, pure subjectivity  
**Function:** paradoxical return to purity after the full cycle of transformation.  
The earliest film becomes the final state: a re‑encounter with childhood, but now conscious, integrated, and transformed.

## 3. Fractal Correspondences Across the Anthology

The cycle is not linear; it is fractal.  
Films resonate across octants:

- *Mirror* ↔ *Solaris*  
  (internal vs. external recursion)

- *Stalker* ↔ *Nostalghia*  
  (trial vs. exile; metaphysical tension vs. metaphysical distance)

- *Ivan’s Childhood* ↔ *The Sacrifice*  
  (origin wound vs. final offering)

- *The Steamroller and the Violin* ↔ the entire cycle  
  (innocence before and after transformation)

These correspondences form a self‑similar lattice across the anthology.

## 4. The Anthology as a 64‑State System

Each film corresponds to one octant (8 states).  
Together, the eight films form a complete **SUBIT‑64 traversal**:

- 8 octants  
- 64 informational states  
- 1 integrated cycle  

The final state is not closure — it is **return**.

---

## 5. Structural Insights

- The anthology is a closed loop of transformation.  
- Each film is a fractal of the whole.  
- The cycle ends where it began, but on a higher level of integration.  
- *The Steamroller and the Violin* is not a prelude — it is the final octave.  
- Tarkovsky’s cinema forms a topological cycle of consciousness.

## 6. Conclusion

Tarkovsky’s anthology maps cleanly onto the SUBIT‑8 structure:

1. Origin  
2. Faith  
3. Memory  
4. Trial  
5. Desire  
6. Exile  
7. Sacrifice  
8. Integration / Return  

The cycle begins in trauma, moves through spiritual and metaphysical transformation, and returns to innocence — not as naivety, but as **integrated purity**.

This is the structural unity of Tarkovsky’s cinematic universe.
