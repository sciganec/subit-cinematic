# Tarkovsky‑64 Meta‑Matrix  
### Unified SUBIT‑64 Archetypal Resonance Map  
### Stalker ↔ Solaris ↔ SUBIT Archetype

This document presents a unified, cross‑film structural mapping of **Stalker (1979)** and **Solaris (1972)** using the **SUBIT‑64** archetypal cycle.

Each of the 64 states corresponds to:

- a **universal SUBIT archetype**,  
- its expression in **Stalker**,  
- its expression in **Solaris**.

This matrix forms the backbone of the **Tarkovsky‑64 Canon**, enabling cross‑film resonance analysis, structural comparison, and future expansion to *Mirror*, *Nostalgia*, *Sacrifice*, and *Ivan’s Childhood*.
